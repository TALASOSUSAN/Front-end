    My name is Susan Talaso,  I am a Student at AkiraChix Pursuing a Diploma in Information Technology.
    Building state-of-the-art, easy to use, user-friendly websites and applications is truly a passion 
    of mine and I am confident I would be an excellent addition to your organization. In addition to my
     knowledge base,I have previously worked as Field Engineer at Fireside  Where I gained Skilled on 
     Cisco Router Installation and Configuration To different offices in an apartment. One of my weaknesses is being too quiet and socially shy. My Directors and Trainers  even pointed this out as an area for improvement during one of my past performance reviews.
     they mentioned that it was very important for me to network and form strong social bonds with other students and I was challenged to attend more events activities and proactively interact and communicate with others 
     Although it has not been a matter of flipping a switch and making an instant transformation from being quiet to an extrovert, I have been taking baby steps and putting myself out there, interacting more with others, striking up conversations, participating in company activities, volunteering in events such as organizing staff baby showers and planning birthday celebrations.
     As a result of these efforts colleagues from other departments are gradually warming up to me and I have even been invited to participate in a few highly visibleepartmental projects.
